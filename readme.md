# MapTool Notebook add-in library

This project is based upon the excellent [notebook library](https://github.com/rtakehara/5e-Framework/tree/master/Resources) by Rod Takehara.

The purpose is to polish and modernize the code to use javascript and the new add-in library functionality in MapTool. 

Unlike the original library, this add-on keeps all notebooks in the data store, and thus avoid the need for tokens to represent each notebook. 
Access to notebooks is handled through an overlay, which presents the available notebooks to each player.
