# Basic Use

Basically *MT Notebook* allows any user to create and maintain notebooks. 
These can be used for personal notes, party notes, game master's notes etc. 
At it's simplest a notebook is a collection of text pages. Each page is composed 
of a title, and a text. The text can of course be pure text, but it can also be 
formatted by using [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

The markdown dialect used in this library is Github Flavored Markdown (GFM), 
with some additions. These additions will be explained later in this guide.

## Accessing the library

As you will probably already have noticed the Notebook library adds an overlay to MapTool called "Library".   
This overlay is available through some icons in the lower left corner of the map view.

As you can see, there are three icons here. A book, a gear and a question mark. 

- The **book icon** opens the actual library and shows you a list of notebooks available. 
- The **gear icon** opens the general setup for the library add-on. 
- The **question mark icon** opens the *About* dialog.
