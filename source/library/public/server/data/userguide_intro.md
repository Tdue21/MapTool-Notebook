# Introduction
Welcome to the user guide for MapTool Notebook.

This add-on library came to as a result of me wanting to learn how to utilize the new add-on functionality in MapTool 1.11.  
In addition I could use it to learn javaScript, a script language I have long wanted to learn, but never really had the 
opportunity to learn. This library is built from scratch, but has been heavily inspired by the excellent 
[notebook library](https://github.com/rtakehara/5e-Framework/tree/master/Resources) by Rod Takehara.

This user guide presents the possibilities of this library, and offers guidance on how to use them.
