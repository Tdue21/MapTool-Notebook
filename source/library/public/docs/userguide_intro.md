# Introduction
Welcome to the user guide for MapTool Notebook.

This add-on library came to as a result of me wanting to learn how to utilize the new add-on functionality in MapTool 1.11.  
In addition I could use it to learn javaScript, a script language I have long wanted to learn, but never really had the 
opportunity to learn. This library is built from scratch, but has been heavily inspired by the excellent 
[notebook library](https://github.com/rtakehara/5e-Framework/tree/master/Resources) by Rod Takehara.

This user guide presents the possibilities of this library, and offers guidance on how to use them. 
   
This is a function call: [r:getPlayerName()].   
This is another: [r:isGM()].   

And here is a table:   
|Header 1     | Header 2      | Header 3 |
| :--- | :---: | ---: |
|Row 1| Value | Value |
|Row 2| Value | Value |
|Row 3| **Value** | Value |

Here we have a [greatsword](roll "1d10+4") damage dice roll.   
Roll a [1d6](roll "1d6").
